## Introduction
Hello,
I will briefly introduce the Redis Databases application, which is open-source and allows us to view real-time data flow on Redis through a graphical interface.

Redis Databases is a useful, simple, and effective interface that enables us to access and modify the key-value pairs stored on Redis.

## Download
To download Redis Databases, you can sign up at **[Redis Databases](https://redis.io/insight/)** and get a 30-day trial version.

## Interface Overview
After downloading and installing Redis Databases, simply click the "Add Redis Database" button to connect to the Redis server where the data will be visualized. Once you enter your information as shown in the image, you can test the connection using "Test Connection." When it says "Test Successful" at the bottom right, the addition process is complete.

## Let's Test It

Previously, we had created and run a Redis container in Docker. If you haven’t deleted it, you can start that container again. Once it’s running successfully, you can access your connection through Redis Databases and view the message we created, as shown in the image below.

For those who are new to Redis or just starting to learn it, I highly recommend using this application.
