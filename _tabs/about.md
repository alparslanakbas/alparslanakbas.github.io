> <strong>My About</strong>
<br> 
I am an experienced software developer specializing in C# and JavaScript/TypeScript. I build modern 
web applications using ASP.NET Core and Blazor, and also create backend solutions with Laravel and 
NodeJs. I am knowledgeable in microservice architecture (other architecture..), REST API 
development, and database management, with expertise in security protocols like IdentityServer4 and 
OAuth 2.0. I am a team player familiar with Agile methodologies and proficient in using version control 
systems like Git and GitHub.  
I can develop solutions that meet modern application requirements using technologies such as NoSQL 
databases (MongoDB, Cassandra, etc.), ElasticSearch, and Redis. My projects include an example 
project using IdentityServer4, which demonstrates my competence in identity management and access 
control. I am eager to learn new technologies and contribute to open-source projects. I am also interested in films, books, and games activities on top of software.
