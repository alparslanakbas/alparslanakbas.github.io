> <strong>My About</strong>
<br> 
My software career started back in 2016. I continued to improve myself even more by adding a university education and various work experiences on top of the software training I have received since high school. Problem-solving and development is my passion. For this reason, I am constantly improving myself and I continue my career with the goal of writing code in real terms. I am also interested in films, books, and games activities on top of software.
